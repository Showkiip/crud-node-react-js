# crud-node-react-js

Description:

CRUD Node React.js is a full-stack web application template hosted on GitHub that demonstrates the implementation of a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using React.js on the frontend and Node.js with Express.js and Mongoose on the backend. The project showcases the use of various technologies and libraries to build a functional and efficient web application.

Key Features:

React.js: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of interactive and responsive components that dynamically update in response to user interactions.

Axios: Axios is utilized in the React.js frontend to handle HTTP requests to the backend server. It provides a simple and intuitive way to send asynchronous HTTP requests and handle responses.

useNavigate: The useNavigate hook is employed to handle navigation in the React.js application. It allows for easy programmatic navigation without the need for React Router or additional routing libraries.

useState: React's useState hook is used to manage state within functional components. It enables the React.js application to keep track of data changes and re-render components accordingly.

Node.js with Express.js: The backend of the application is powered by Node.js, a runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript. Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, is used to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration.

Mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and is used in the backend to provide an elegant and structured way to interact with the MongoDB database. It simplifies data validation, querying, and schema management.

CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is implemented in the Node.js backend using the CORS middleware. This allows the React.js frontend to make HTTP requests to the Node.js server even if they originate from a different domain.

Installation and Usage:

To use the CRUD Node React.js application, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
Navigate to the backend folder and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Configure your MongoDB database connection in the backend application.
Start the backend server by running npm start.
Next, navigate to the frontend folder and run npm install to install the required frontend dependencies.
Start the React.js development server with npm start.
Access the application in your web browser at the specified URL.
